# C5 - Work Day Scheduler

## Description
This project was to create a daily scheduler for better time management. The current time and day is written and color coded to let the user know the exact time and schedule. The yellow save button on the right hand side is used to save the event and is saved until removed or changed by adding a different event. 

## Mock-Up
The following shows the schedule mock-up. The colors on the mock-up are displayed differently than the project. The mock-up has grey as past, red as present and green as future. Whereas the project has yellow as past, green as present and purple as future.
